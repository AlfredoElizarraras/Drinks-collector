## Project management
I used github [project management](https://github.com/users/AlfredoElizarraras/projects/3) to manage apps deadlines and due dates.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.1
- Ruby on Rails v6.0.3
- Postgresql

## Live Demo

[Drinks collector live app](https://drinks-collector.herokuapp.com)

### Prerequisites

- Ruby: 2.7.1
- Rails: 6.0.3
- Postgres: >=10.12

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps

- Clone the repository by running in the console of your local machine the following command

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/AlfredoElizarraras/Drinks-collector.git
  ```
- Change directory to Drinks-collector folder.

### Setup

If you have another ruby version and have rbenv, you can run:
```
  rbenv install 2.7.1
```

Install gems with:

```
bundle install
```

Setup database with:

```
  sudo -u postgres psql
  CREATE ROLE developer WITH CREATEDB LOGIN PASSWORD 'pass123';
```
  Exit postgres console \q
  Make sure you have your yarn packages up to date. If not:
```
  yarn install --check-files
```
  Then
```
   rails db:setup
   rails db:migrate
```



### Usage

#### Notes for development
1. As this is a web app is better to test it in a mobile, for this you can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
In ngrok page follow the instructions to download it for your own specific OS, then you can follow this [cool post](https://dev.to/ianvaughan/ngrok-on-rails-315m) that I followed in order to have ngrok running for development.
So you can do the following:
   1. Start ngrok in the console (in the folder directory you download and extract ngrok)
   ```
       ./ngrok http 3000
       export NGROK_HOST=ngrokHTTPSgivenURL
   ```
   
   2. Start server with:
   
   ```
       rails server
   ```
   3. Now you have to be able to visit ngrok given url in your mobile phone.
      OR

      Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

2. For testing omniauth authentication is better if you use another deployment site or use github as it is the only one of the three providers that accepts call backs for local host 3000


### Run tests

```
    rpsec spec/models/. --format documentation
    rpsec spec/features/. --format documentation
```

### Deployment

- Change 'xyz' part so you have your own Drinks collector app deployed.
```
 heroku create drinks-collector-xyz
 git push heroku +HEAD:master
 heroku run rails db:migrate
```
- To manage Enviroment variables I used [Figaro gem](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro), so you can push the variables to heroku as in the figaros gem documentation
```
 figaro heroku:set -e production
```
